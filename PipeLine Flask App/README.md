# Project Title

FindMyDoggo - Exploring Machine Learing Techniques to Identify Dogs.


### Prerequisites

Only a few prerequisites in order to follow the steps below.

```
Python3
Pip Installs Packages(PIP)
```


## Getting Started
Firstly, a demo of the application is hosted here: [findmydoggo.co.uk](http://findmydoggo.co.uk) Funny that .co.uk domain name was free ??

Otherwise if you wish to run this project on your own machine and deploy on your local host server follow these instructions:
* See previous heading Prerequisites for manditory programs that should already be installed on your machine
* Run the following command:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Ciaran-OBrien/FYP
```
* Navigate to the Flask App folder
* Run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Once everything is installed succesfully, run the following to start the webapp
```
flask run
```

* Point your web browser to the promted webserver address: [127.0.0.1:5000](127.0.0.1:5000)


## Built With

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/) - A Microframework
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) - Programming language of choice
* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) - Image Processing Library
* [DarkNet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) - Open source neural network framework providing YOLOv3 Network 
* [Keras](https://keras.io) - Deep Learling Library providing ResNet50 Network
* [Gluon-CV](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/api/index.html) - Deep Learning Toolkit providing the Mask R-CNN Network

## Acknowledgments
In the process of this dissertation, I was fortunate to obtain the assistance of many people, whom I would like to present my genuine thanks. My appreciation goes first to my supervisor, Dr. John Gilligan. His guidance and attention to detail ensured that I and the project both stayed on track

My next appreciation goes to my second supervisor, Prof. Dr. Bernhard G. Humm. My work with Humm is a part of the EDDIT programme, a dual degree from Technological University of Dublin, and Hochschule Darmstadt.

The project gained extra assistance from many different lectures, and in part would not be possible without the support from all the staff and lectures at TUD.
Finally, I would also like to thank my family for all their encouragement and assistance during this project.
