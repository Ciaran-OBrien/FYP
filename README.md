There are two three folders

## Colour Extraction 

This folder inlcudes the Jupyter Notebook that runs through how to extract the dominant colours of a given image input.

## Breed Classification
This folder inlcued the Jupyter Notebook that builds a CNN using Keras and implements transfer learning to add the weights associated with classification of dog breeds.

## Prototype
All prototype images and files are included here.

# Prerequisites
Must be installed prior to running.

The Prototype xml file was created with Draw.io. Other Prototyping tools may open the file, not tested though.
